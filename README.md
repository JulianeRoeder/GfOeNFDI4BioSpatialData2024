**We have questions...**

First of all - how did you get here? (Multiple answers possible)

- [[walk]]                   I walked. Took me some days to reach Marburg, but I enjoyed the [Lahnwanderweg](https://www.lahnwanderweg.de/).
- [[bike]]                   By bike. All the way.
- [[ÖPNV]]                   ÖPNV - public transport. I live in Marburg/in Hesse. I have a Landesticket 8-)
- [[train]]                  By train. I love the Deutsche Bahn adventure <3
- [[car]]                    By car. I'm from a place without public transport. I living "ländlich" (rural).
- [[plane]]                  By plane. Marburg doesn't have an airport, so I had to land on the B3.
